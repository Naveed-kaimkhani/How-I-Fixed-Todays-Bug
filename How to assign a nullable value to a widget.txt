Null Safety is an amazing feature of dart that makes flutter more Powerfull and Robust .
While working with null safety compiler show a compile time error if you are using a nullable value tha might be null in running state of your Application.
So to deal with this situation null safety comes in handy. and we have plenty of null check operator to overcome this issue.
Before compiling the code it is the responsibility of developer to check is there any value that can be null and how to deal with.
For Example: I want to show a String to UI that can be null and i have to assign some other value to this String if it is null.


Text(user.name); => Text is the widget that is responsible for showing text on UI and i have to assign some other value if it null
Text(user?.name??"No Username"); => And this is how i can tackle this error.
